 *
 * This file is intentionally empty - stubs for global accessors like
 * get_runtime_config() are already provided by test_test_config.cpp.
 *
 * If additional stubs are needed specifically for application module tests,
 * add them here. For now, the existing test infrastructure provides all
 * necessary stubs.

// Note: PrinterState, MoonrakerClient, and MoonrakerAPI stubs are provided
// by the test fixtures when needed, not as global stubs. This allows each
// test to have its own isolated instance.
