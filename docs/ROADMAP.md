## Current Priorities

### 1. AMS/Multi-Material Support
**Status:** Planning

Support for Automatic Material System (AMS) and multi-material printing:
- [ ] Multi-extruder temperature display
- [ ] Filament slot selection UI
- [ ] Tool change status during prints
- [ ] AMS error handling and recovery

See `docs/AMS_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` for detailed specification.

### 2. Production Hardening
**Status:** In Progress

- [x] **Connection-aware navigation** - Disable Controls/Filament when disconnected, auto-navigate to home
- [x] **Reconnection flow UX** - Toast notifications for disconnect/reconnect/klippy states
- [ ] **Structured logging** - Log levels, rotation, remote debugging
- [ ] **Edge case testing** - Print failures, filesystem errors

### 3. Documentation Gaps
**Status:** Ongoing

- [ ] User manual for end users (non-developer)
- [ ] Hardware installation guide per target platform
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide

## Backlog (Lower Priority)

| Feature | Priority | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| **Console/logs viewer** | Low | Klipper console access from UI |
| **mDNS discovery** | Low | Auto-find Moonraker (manual IP works) |
| **OTA updates** | Future | Currently requires manual binary update |

## Architecture Principles

- **Reactive Pattern:** All UI state via Subject-Observer bindings
- **XML First:** Layout in XML, logic in C++
- **RAII Lifecycle:** PanelBase, ObserverGuard, ModalBase for safe cleanup
- **Design Tokens:** Colors, spacing, typography from globals.xml
- **Capability Detection:** Features shown/hidden based on printer capabilities
- **Mock Testing:** `--test` flag enables offline development
