## Backlog (Lower Priority)

| Feature | Priority | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| **Client-side thumbnail extraction** | Low | Fallback when Moonraker doesn't provide thumbnails (e.g., USB symlinked files). Would download G-code header via Moonraker file API and use `gcode_parser::extract_thumbnails()` locally. See `src/gcode_parser.cpp`. |
| **mDNS discovery** | Low | Auto-find Moonraker (manual IP works) |
| **OTA updates** | Future | Currently requires manual binary update |
| **User manual** | Future | End-user documentation |

## Architecture Principles

- **Reactive Pattern:** All UI state via Subject-Observer bindings
- **XML First:** Layout in XML, logic in C++
- **RAII Lifecycle:** PanelBase, ObserverGuard, ModalBase for safe cleanup
- **Design Tokens:** Colors, spacing, typography from globals.xml
- **Capability Detection:** Features shown/hidden based on printer capabilities
- **Mock Testing:** `--test` flag enables offline development
