## Navigation Overview

HelixScreen uses a consistent navigation pattern with a **left sidebar** containing five navigation buttons:

| Icon | Panel | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| Home | Home | Printer status at a glance |
| Tune | Controls | Motion, temperature, fan controls |
| Spool | Filament | Load, unload, filament profiles |
| Gear | Settings | Display, sound, network options |
| Dots | Advanced | Calibration, history, system tools |

> **Note:** Print Select is accessed from the **Home panel** (tap the print area), not from the navbar. Controls and Filament require a printer connection and appear disabled when disconnected.

## Tips & Tricks

### Temperature Shortcuts

Tap a temperature display on the Home panel to jump directly to its control panel.

### Quick Navigation

From any sub-panel, the navigation bar always takes you back to main panels.

### Pre-Print Checks

The pre-print options remember your last choices per slicer. If you always run bed mesh before PrusaSlicer prints, that preference persists.

### Disconnection Handling

If connection is lost:
1. HelixScreen shows a reconnection toast
2. Automatic reconnection attempts every few seconds
3. When reconnected, state is restored automatically
4. During disconnection, Controls and Filament panels are disabled (safety)

### AMS/Multi-Material

For Happy Hare or AFC-Klipper systems:
- Slot status shows on home panel
- Use Filament panel for load/unload operations
- Color information comes from Spoolman (if integrated)

### Memory Usage

HelixScreen is optimized for low memory:
- Typical usage: 50-80MB
- No X server or desktop environment needed
- Direct framebuffer rendering

### Log Viewing

For troubleshooting, view logs from SSH:
```bash
# Live logs
sudo journalctl -u helixscreen -f

# Last 100 lines
sudo journalctl -u helixscreen -n 100
```
